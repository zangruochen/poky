SUMMARY = "Backported and Experimental Type Hints for Python 3.7+"
DESCRIPTION = "The typing_extensions module serves two related purposes:\
\
* Enable use of new type system features on older Python versions. For \
  example, typing.TypeGuard is new in Python 3.10, but typing_extensions \
  allows users on previous Python versions to use it too.\
* Enable experimentation with new type system PEPs before they are accepted \
  and added to the typing module."
